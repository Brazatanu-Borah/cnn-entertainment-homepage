# cnn-entertainment-homepage
 This is a project where I try to recreate the homepage of CNN's entertainment section's homepage using html and css. First I will use floats, px units and will be non responsive and as I learn more I will update the project to include more modern css features like rem units, flexbox, media queries, optimized images and so on.
